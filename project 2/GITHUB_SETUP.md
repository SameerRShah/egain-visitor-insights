# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ **Local Git Repository Created**: All project files have been committed to a local git repository in `/home/ubuntu/project/`

## How to Create GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click "New Repository"** (green button or + icon)
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `egain-visitor-insights`
   - **Description**: `Sales Engineer Home Assignment - Visitor Intelligence Platform for eGain Sales Teams`
   - **Visibility**: Public (so eGain can access it)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

4. **After creating the repository**, GitHub will show you commands to push existing code. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/ubuntu/project

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/egain-visitor-insights.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/project
gh repo create egain-visitor-insights --public --description "Sales Engineer Home Assignment - Visitor Intelligence Platform for eGain Sales Teams"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/egain-visitor-insights.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will contain:

```
