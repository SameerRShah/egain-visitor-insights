The solution should empower the sales rep with the best possible insights about the visitors and should be easily searchable by various attributes (you decide what attributes might be useful for an eGain sales rep for any given account/contact), including any other insights you can offer about the visitor or visitors from any target company of interest for the rep. feel free to consider using commercial and open-source info services to build your solution..
